Bikeshare project documentation
### Date created
July 24,2022

### Project Title
explore-US-bikeshare-data

### Description
(1) General information
In this project I am going to refactor my previous bikeshare project using Git.
I forked the current Udacity repository to get my own copy of a template for this project,
so that I have a remote repository in my Github account.
Then I cloned it to my computer.
I added my bikeshare_george.py file and a .gitignore file to exclude the three city data files
from version control tracking.
I will create and work on two branches.
Finally I will merge both branches to the master branch
and put it back to the remote repository in my Github account.

(2) Delete unnecessary comment from Line 125 to 134

(3) Change the string variable "city_list" to "cityList" twice at Lines 17 and 19

### Files used
Bikeshare_george.py
The three city data files include washinton.csv, chicago.csv and new_york_city.csv.
README.md
.gitignore
